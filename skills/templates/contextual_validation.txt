[SKILL 5 - CONTEXTUAL_VALIDATION]
Apply the following checks to detect contextual and semantic forgeries.

CRITICAL CONTEXT — Know your target:
Metadata fields (date, time) represent ~18% of forged modifications. Company information
~6%. Forgers often change a date or store name to make a receipt suitable for a
fraudulent expense claim. These changes are semantically inconsistent even when visually subtle.

IMPORTANT — Distinguish forgeries from benign annotations:
Some AUTHENTIC receipts have handwritten notes (circled dates, added account numbers, written
names) or typed annotations. These are NOT forgeries. Focus on whether the printed receipt
content itself is internally consistent — not on external marks added by the recipient.

Checks to perform:
- DATE PLAUSIBILITY: Verify the purchase date is plausible.
  • Not in the future (relative to today's date).
  • Not impossibly old (receipts older than ~10 years are suspicious).
  • Format is consistent with the receipt's apparent locale/country.
  • Day-of-week (if shown) must match the calendar date.
  • Time of purchase must be plausible for the store type (e.g., no grocery purchases at 3AM).
- METADATA FIELD (DATE/TIME) FORGERY: A modified date is a common forgery type (IMI/PIX).
  Check whether the date appears visually consistent with surrounding text (same font, same
  ink rendering, same position alignment in the date field).
- STORE NAME AND IDENTITY: Verify the store name is coherent and specific.
  • Generic names like "Store Name", "My Shop", "Company", or placeholder text = FAKE.
  • The store name should be consistent with the apparent business type and locale.
  • Phone number format should match the apparent country.
  • Address format (if present) should be realistic for the apparent region.
- ITEM PLAUSIBILITY FOR STORE TYPE: Products should be consistent with the store type.
  • A grocery store should not sell electronics.
  • A pharmacy receipt with restaurant food items is suspicious.
  • Brand names should be plausible for the market (no invented brands).
- CURRENCY AND LOCALE CONSISTENCY: Currency symbols must match the apparent country.
  Prices, tax rates, and payment methods must be regionally plausible.
- PAYMENT METHOD CONSISTENCY: If card payment is shown, check for last-4 digits or card
  type. If cash, verify change is shown. Card type (Visa/MC/Amex) should match card number
  format hints if visible.
- INTERNAL CONTRADICTIONS: Flag any field that contradicts another.
  Examples: date says "Sunday" but store hours would be closed; receipt is labeled
  "Tax Invoice" but shows no tax; subtotal and total are identical with a non-zero tax.
- RECEIPT NUMBER / SEQUENCE: If a receipt or transaction number is shown, it should be
  plausible (not zero, not obviously sequential like "0001" suggesting a template).
Record result as: pass, fail, or uncertain.
