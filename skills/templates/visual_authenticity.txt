[SKILL 3 - VISUAL_AUTHENTICITY]
Apply the following checks to detect visual and image-level forgeries.

CRITICAL CONTEXT — Know your target:
This dataset's receipts were forged primarily using COPY-PASTE INSIDE (CPI) — a region from
the same document is duplicated and placed elsewhere (~77% of all forgeries). Secondary methods
include pixel editing (PIX), character deletion (CUT), and external paste (CPO). This means:
  • Most forgeries are SUBTLE: a single number altered, not wholesale replacement.
  • Look specifically at price fields and totals — they are the most common targets.
  • Copy-paste artifacts appear as regions with unnaturally consistent pixel patterns.

IMPORTANT — Distinguish forgeries from benign annotations:
Some AUTHENTIC receipts contain handwritten notes (checkmarks, underlines, circled amounts,
stamps) or digital marks (typed additions). These are NOT forgeries. Do NOT flag authentic
annotation marks as evidence of tampering. Forgeries involve fraudulent modification of the
receipt's financial or identifying information.

Checks to perform:
- COPY-PASTE TRACES: Look for hard edges, halos, subtle color fringing, or unnatural sharpness
  boundaries around individual characters or numeric values. Pay special attention to price
  columns and total fields. A copied character may have a slightly different background shade.
- JPEG COMPRESSION INCONSISTENCY: Flag areas where JPEG block artifacts differ from surrounding
  regions — edited areas (especially in PNG images saved as JPEG at some point) may show
  different compression levels within the same image.
- PIXEL-LEVEL MODIFICATIONS (PIX): Check for individual characters that appear drawn or
  modified at pixel level — e.g., a "1" turned into a "7", or a "0" added. Look for jagged
  edges, mismatched pixel density, or stroke width inconsistencies on specific digits.
- ERASED / WHITENED AREAS: Flag rectangular white patches, smudging, or unnatural uniform-color
  regions where content was removed. Check if surrounding pixels show compression artifacts
  inconsistent with a clean white background.
- TEXT OVERLAY (DIGITAL INSERTION): Flag text or numbers that appear artificially placed —
  no paper texture visible underneath, different rendering subpixel hinting, or text that
  casts no shadow on the document surface.
- RESOLUTION MISMATCHES: Check if specific regions (especially altered price fields) appear
  at different resolution or sharpness than the surrounding scan. Copy-pasted content from
  another source may have different DPI or anti-aliasing.
- PAPER TEXTURE CONSISTENCY: Verify that the paper texture (grain, fold lines, scanner noise)
  is uniform across the document. Pasted regions may show unnaturally clean backgrounds.
- LIGHTING & SHADOW UNIFORMITY: Ensure lighting gradients and scanner exposure are consistent.
  Areas with edits often lack the natural brightness falloff of adjacent regions.
Record result as: pass, fail, or uncertain.
