[SKILL 1 - MATH_CONSISTENCY]
Apply the following checks to detect numerical forgeries:
- Verify that the sum of all individual item prices equals the subtotal.
- Verify that subtotal + tax amount = grand total (check for plausible tax rates: 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%).
- Verify that quantity × unit price = line total for every item.
- Check that discounts or coupons are correctly subtracted.
- Flag any impossible rounding (e.g., cents that don't match standard rounding rules).
- Flag totals that are suspiciously round numbers when line items suggest they should not be.
- Flag negative values, zero-price items with descriptions, or blank numeric fields.
Record result as: pass (all checks pass), fail (at least one check fails), uncertain (cannot read numbers clearly).
