[SKILL 1 - MATH_CONSISTENCY]
Apply the following checks to detect numerical forgeries.

CRITICAL CONTEXT — Know your target:
In the Find-It-Again dataset, Total/Payment fields are the MOST TARGETED entity (~51% of all
forged modifications). Product prices (line items) are the second most common target (~21%).
This means: if any forgery exists, it almost certainly involves the numbers. Scrutinize ALL
monetary values with maximum precision.

Checks to perform:
- LINE ITEM TOTALS: For every product line, verify quantity × unit_price = line_total.
  A single copied-and-modified price (CPI forgery) will create an arithmetic mismatch.
- SUBTOTAL VERIFICATION: Verify the sum of all individual item prices = stated subtotal.
  Even a single modified price creates a discrepancy. Consider rounding conventions (up/down).
- TAX CALCULATION: Verify subtotal + tax = grand total. Accept common tax rates:
  5%, 6%, 7%, 8%, 9%, 10%, 12%, 15%, 18%, 20%, 23%, 25%.
  Flag any tax rate that falls outside these plausible ranges.
- GRAND TOTAL CONSISTENCY: Cross-check grand total against all other numeric values.
  If "TOTAL DUE" ≠ sum of items + tax, this is strong evidence of forgery.
- PAYMENT ARITHMETIC: If cash payment is shown, verify: cash_tendered ≥ total AND
  change = cash_tendered − total. If card, the charged amount must equal total.
- SUSPICIOUS ROUND NUMBERS: Flag totals that are suspiciously round (e.g., $100.00, $50.00)
  when individual items suggest the result should be irregular. Round totals are a common
  artifact of forgers who change the total without adjusting the line items.
- DISCOUNT / COUPON ARITHMETIC: Verify discounts are correctly subtracted from subtotal.
  Check for impossible discounts (greater than the item price, or negative after discount).
- IMPOSSIBLE VALUES: Flag negative item prices, zero-price items with descriptions, blank
  numeric fields where a value is expected, or quantities that are non-integers for
  countable items.
- DUPLICATE VALUES: Check if identical monetary values appear in suspicious positions
  (e.g., two different items with exact same price, or line total = grand total).
  These can indicate a value was copy-pasted from elsewhere in the receipt.
Record result as: pass (all checks pass), fail (at least one check fails),
uncertain (cannot read numbers clearly due to image quality).
