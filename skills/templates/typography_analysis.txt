[SKILL 2 - TYPOGRAPHY_ANALYSIS]
Apply the following checks to detect typographic forgeries.

CRITICAL CONTEXT — Know your target:
The most common forgery methods involving typography are:
  • IMI (Imitation Insertion, ~8%): A character or number is replaced using a text tool that
    attempts to match the original font. Look for subtle size, weight, or spacing differences.
  • CPI (Copy-Paste Inside, ~78%): A character or value is copied from elsewhere in the
    receipt and pasted in a new location. The typography may match perfectly but spatial
    context (alignment, column consistency) may not.
  • PIX (Pixel editing, ~7%): A single stroke is added to a character (e.g., "1" → "7",
    "0" → "8"). Look for digital stroke artifacts that don't match thermal printing quality.

IMPORTANT — Distinguish forgeries from benign annotations:
Handwritten marks (checkmarks, underlines, circled items, stamps, added names/numbers in
pen or marker) are NOT forgeries. They are authentic non-fraudulent annotations. Do NOT
flag handwritten elements as typographic forgeries.

Checks to perform:
- FONT CONSISTENCY: Verify that a single consistent font family is used for printed text.
  Flag any section where the font rendering differs from the surrounding content.
- SERIF/SANS-SERIF MIX: Flag unexpected mixing of serif and sans-serif fonts in positions
  where consistency would be expected (e.g., item names in a different font than adjacent items).
- CHARACTER SPACING AND BASELINE: Detect irregular letter-spacing, kerning anomalies,
  or baseline misalignment for specific characters — especially in numeric fields.
  A copied character may be slightly above or below the baseline of its neighbors.
- WEIGHT AND SIZE INCONSISTENCIES: Flag characters that appear bolder, lighter, or at a
  slightly different point size than surrounding text. This is a key indicator of IMI forgeries.
- RESOLUTION AND RENDERING MISMATCH: Detect text that appears at different resolution,
  sharpness, or anti-aliasing compared to its neighbors. Copy-pasted text from a
  different source document may render at different DPI or with different subpixel hinting.
- TEXT OVERLAY HALO: Flag text that appears to float on top of the image with a halo
  effect, mismatched background color, or no paper texture visible underneath.
- PIXEL-STROKE ARTIFACTS: Look for digits where individual pixel strokes appear digitally
  drawn rather than thermally printed — uneven stroke width, jagged edges, or pixel-art
  appearance in otherwise smooth font rendering.
- CAPITALIZATION AND ENCODING: Check for inconsistent capitalization patterns within
  the same text style, or encoding artifacts (replacement characters, garbled symbols).
Record result as: pass, fail, or uncertain.
