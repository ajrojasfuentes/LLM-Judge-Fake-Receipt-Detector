=== DATASET CONTEXT (Read before analyzing) ===
You are analyzing scanned receipts looking for signs of forgery to classify each receipt as real or forged. Key facts that inform your analysis:

1. DOMINANT FORGERY METHOD — CPI (Copy-Paste Inside, ~78%):
   The most common forgery copies a character, number, or region FROM WITHIN THE SAME RECEIPT
   and pastes it elsewhere. This means:
   • Forgeries are often SUBTLE — a single digit changed, not a wholesale replacement.
   • Look for slight copy-paste artifacts (halo, edge mismatch, background inconsistency)
     around individual numbers, especially in price and total columns.

2. MOST TARGETED FIELDS:
   • Total / Payment section (~51% of modifications) — scrutinize ALL totals.
   • Product prices / line items (~21%) — verify arithmetic for every line item.
   • Metadata (date, time) (~18%) — check date plausibility and visual consistency.

3. HARD NEGATIVES — Do NOT confuse these with forgeries:
   • Handwritten annotations: pen marks, checkmarks, circled amounts, stamps, underlines.
     These are authentic non-fraudulent marks made by the receipt recipient. NOT forgeries.
   • Digital annotations: typed additions (account numbers, names, comments) added
     non-fraudulently to authentic receipts. NOT forgeries.
   Only flag modifications to the PRINTED FINANCIAL CONTENT as evidence of forgery.

4. FORGERY CHARACTERISTICS TO WATCH:
   • A single number that doesn't "add up" with the rest.
   • A date that seems inconsistent with surrounding content or context.
   • A price field where the typography slightly differs from neighboring fields.
   • A total that is suspiciously round when line items suggest otherwise.

=== FORENSIC ANALYSIS ===
You must thoroughly analyze the PNG image of the receipt {receipt_id}.png and, secondarily, the other attached images and additional information that correspond to preprocessed data from the receipt image, and apply the following skills in order. For each skill, perform the described checks and record a result as "pass," "fail," or "uncertain."

---
{skills_assigned}
---

After applying all the skills, output EXACTLY the following JSON object and nothing else.
Do NOT include markdown code fences, explanations, or any text outside the JSON.

REQUIRED OUTPUT FORMAT:
{output_schema}

STRICT RULES:
1. "label" MUST be exactly one of: "REAL", "FAKE", or "UNCERTAIN"
2. "confidence" MUST be a float between 0.0 and 100.0, and must be a critically and judiciously generated value, not overestimating your confidence in the prediction made
3. "reasons" MUST be a list of 2 to 4 short, specific observations (each under 20 words)
4. "skill_results" MUST contain all 5 skills with values "pass", "fail", or "uncertain"
5. "flags" MUST be a list of uppercase flag codes from the approved list
6. "risk_level" MUST be exactly one of: "low", "medium", "high"
7. Your response MUST be valid JSON. Any invalid JSON will be rejected and retried.
8. Benign annotations (handwritten/digital marks) are NOT evidence of forgery.

APPROVED FLAG CODES:
TOTAL_MISMATCH, TAX_ERROR, LINE_ITEM_ERROR, FONT_INCONSISTENCY, TEXT_OVERLAY, COPY_PASTE_ARTIFACT, COMPRESSION_ANOMALY, MISSING_FIELDS, TEMPLATE_LAYOUT, IMPLAUSIBLE_DATE, IMPLAUSIBLE_STORE, CURRENCY_MISMATCH, PAYMENT_INCONSISTENCY, ERASED_CONTENT, RESOLUTION_MISMATCH, SUSPICIOUS_ROUND_TOTAL
