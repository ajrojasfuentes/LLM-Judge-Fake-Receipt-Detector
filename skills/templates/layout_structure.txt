[SKILL 4 - LAYOUT_STRUCTURE]
Apply the following checks to detect structural and layout forgeries.

CRITICAL CONTEXT — Know your target:
CPI (Copy-Paste Inside) forgeries, which dominate this dataset (~78%), may disrupt layout
by inserting a duplicated region that slightly misaligns with the surrounding grid.
Also, Total/Payment fields (the most targeted entity) may show layout anomalies when
a forger modifies the amount without adjusting the surrounding spacing.

IMPORTANT — Distinguish forgeries from benign annotations:
Handwritten notes, stamps, or circled areas may appear "off-grid" but are authentic.
Focus on whether the PRINTED content itself follows a coherent spatial layout.

Checks to perform:
- STANDARD RECEIPT STRUCTURE: Verify the receipt follows a standard flow:
    header (store name, address, phone, date/time) → item list (name | qty | price) →
    subtotal / tax / grand total → payment method → footer.
  Flag missing mandatory sections (no store name, no date, no total).
- COLUMN ALIGNMENT CONSISTENCY: Check that the price/amount column is right-aligned
  consistently throughout the item list. A forged price that was pasted may be slightly
  shifted left or right relative to the column baseline.
- TOTAL SECTION LAYOUT: The total section (subtotal, tax, total) must be spatially distinct
  from item lines. Flag if total values appear to be misaligned with preceding items,
  or if the grand total is not clearly visually separated.
- VERTICAL SPACING IRREGULARITIES: Check for unusual gaps or compressed spacing between
  specific line items. A deleted line (CUT forgery) may leave irregular whitespace.
  A copy-pasted line may create an unusually narrow or wide gap.
- DUPLICATE LINE DETECTION: Check whether any line item appears twice with identical or
  very similar content. CPI forgeries copy content within the document.
- TEMPLATE DETECTION: Flag layouts that look like generic receipt generator output:
  perfectly uniform spacing everywhere, placeholder-style content, too clean for a real
  scanned document.
- PAYMENT SECTION COHERENCE: The payment section must be internally consistent with
  the grand total and physically positioned after the total section.
- FOOTER APPROPRIATENESS: Footer content (thank-you messages, return policies, barcodes,
  QR codes) should be appropriate for the apparent store type and locale.
  A forger who modifies a receipt may not adjust the footer to match.
Record result as: pass, fail, or uncertain.
